# Machine learning assisted topology optimization 
## Targets:
* Create a porous structure from geometry-defining parameters
* Optimize the porous structure to minimize the max Von Mises stress
* Use Bayesian optimization because the mechanical simulations have long execution times
* Combine the individual steps into an automated pipeline that logs the results

## Description:
Topology optimization reduces material usage while maintaining performance. A precise but computationally expensive approach to determining performance considers energetic transitions but can be accelerated with machine learning algorithms. The design space is explored efficiently with a Bayesian optimization scheme; AI is used to predict the strength of a given topology.
  
* Porespy: Generate PNGs of 2D material structure
* MOOSE: Run stress simulations on the structure
* BoTorch: Bayesian optimization is used to find the new candidates of parameters that are likely to yield a new optimal von Mises stress
